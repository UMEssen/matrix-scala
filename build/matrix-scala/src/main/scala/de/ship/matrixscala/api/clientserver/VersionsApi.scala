    * Gets the versions of the specification supported by the server.
    *
    * Values will take the form `vX.Y` or `rX.Y.Z` in historical cases. See
    * [the Specification Versioning](../#specification-versions) for more
    * information.
    *
    * The server may additionally advertise experimental features it supports
    * through `unstable_features`. These features should be namespaced and
    * may optionally include version information within their name if desired.
    * Features listed here are not for optionally toggling parts of the Matrix
    * specification and should only be used to advertise support for a feature
    * which has not yet landed in the spec. For example, a feature currently
    * undergoing the proposal process may appear here and eventually be taken
    * off this list once the feature lands in the spec and the server deems it
    * reasonable to do so. Servers may wish to keep advertising features here
    * after they've been released into the spec to give clients a chance to
    * upgrade appropriately. Additionally, clients should avoid using unstable
    * features in their stable releases.
